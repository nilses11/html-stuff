## Recommended: Live Preview for Testing

For easy testing and previewing of your HTML game, install the **Live Preview** extension in VS Code:

1. Open the Extensions sidebar (Ctrl+Shift+X).
2. Search for `Live Preview` by Microsoft and install it.
3. Open `typingwords.html` in the editor.
4. Click the "Go Live" button in the editor's top right, or right-click the file and select **Show Preview**.
5. Your game will open in a browser tab inside VS Code for instant feedback as you edit.

This makes it quick and easy to test changes without leaving your editor.
